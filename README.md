# To Do List

By: _Eva Kemp_

## **Technologies Used**

- C#
- .NET
- Git

## **Description**

This is a project that corresponds to multiple lessons within the LearnHowToProgram.com walkthrough on creating a To Do List application in [Section 2: Basic Web Applications](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications).
It allows a user to add items to their own To-Do List.

## How To Run This Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList".
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).

### To run tests

- Navigate to the `ToDoList.Tests` directory
- In the command line, run the command `dotnet test`

## **Known Bugs**
